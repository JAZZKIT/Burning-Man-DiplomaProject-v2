                                    <p class="timeline-text">Eric FAURE, former collaborator of Adam Gilliéron, can not bring himself to see Wild Circus disappear and buy the company convinced that it can be revived. He modernized management and quickly returned to popular and financial success to make it one of the jewels of the Swiss and European circus in a few years. Jean FAURE shares this great adventure with his family and thus creates a new circus dynasty. His wife Edwige, actively participates in the reorganization of the company as General Manager, and his children, Lucie, great illusionist, and Louis, tamer of wild animals, are recognized artists.</p>

                                    <p class="timeline-text">In the spring of 2015, like many entertainment companies, Wild Circus faces difficulties and must stop its tour. Passionate, man of challenges, Jean FAURE cannot resolve the disappearance of this flagship of the circus that he has helped to develop and keep alive for more than 30 years. Surrounded by his team, he decides that Wild Circus will be present in Monaco as every year. He entrusts the operational direction to his right hand Edward Snowden and the artistic direction to Michael McIntyre, a young artist and director already recognized. Together, they are betting on offering a completely new show that showcases the new generation of Swiss artists, all with respect for the traditional circus.</p>
